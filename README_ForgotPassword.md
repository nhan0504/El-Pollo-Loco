#### Nodemailer: SMTP Transport
- What is it?
    - Allows you to pipeline emails from NodeJS to an SMTP account for sending
- Outlook
    - Difficulties: Worked great with outlook until Outlook locked our account 
        - Most personal email providers like outlook, gmail etc consider services like nodemailer “less secure” and will send to associated emails to spam box or lock accounts
- Email API Services
    - Email API services are commonly used in practice with nodemailer
        - Difficulties: Most of the services require payment (sendgrid, mailgun, postmark, twilio)
    - Mailtrap
        - Email API service with a free tier
        - Requires a custom domain or subdomain to be configured to nodemailer via DNS settings
        - Difficulties: Unable to configure and connect to our Heroku subdomain
#### Nodemailer: Sendmail Transport
- What is it?
    - Allows you to pipeline emails from NodeJS to the Unix Sendmail command in order to send emails
- Difficulties:
    - Difficult to test on windows without Unix
        - Requires Windows Subsystem for Linux or similar installation in order to run Unix Sendmail (Can be configured via the Nodemailer Application as well).
    - Unable to test on Heroku
        - Deploying and testing on Heroku proved to be more difficult than expected and we were not able to sufficiently test Nodemailer with the Sendmail protocol 
#### Options for Continued Development
- Nodemailer Application
    - Nodemailer application allows you to create a local SMTP server to upload emails to.  This catches emails sent from NodeJS and saves them to disk.  They then can be uploaded in “batches” to a SMTP server for sending.
    - Allows for easier testing and scalability, alongside Nodemailer Sendmail or SMTP Transport
